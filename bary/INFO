CMC Apr. 18 2005.  Replaced the existing bcvel.ascii with one
which incorporates these improvements:

f01.logsheet had only partially been run for its BC's.
Ran the whole thing an inserted the missing portoin into
bcvel.ascii.  Note that several Ty stars are observed on
this run but non of the stars, can be found in the tycho
catalog!

Fixed some name changes that had not been made in the original
name change over:  GL414A to 97101,   219B to 4614.  These
stars were not change because they had some quirks, such
as not being SIMBAD listable plus having been dropped, etc.
Checked for other stars in this catagory and didn't find any.

__________________________

This is the ALL IDL version of the new barycode for LICK.
TO install this I

1.) Generated bcvel.ascii with new name convention, including (after
a correction) "HR" designations for all B stars

2.) Started with the Keck bary software

3.) modified all lick dependancies.

New bary improvements:

--All IDL (no Fortran) reading of ephemeris programs
  (including package programs fxb* and my replacement
    programs j*.pro, ie jnutation.pro)
--Removal of secular acceleration.

Here's a summary of the Keck Changes.

> Hi Paul,
>
> OK.  Chris McCarthy has assembled the new barycentric
> package for the Keck project.  We spent today
> testing it in many ways.  We looked in detail at the
> changes to the barycentric velocities that emerge
> from the new code compared to the old code.
>
> There were many improvements that Chris instituted.
> Among them are:
>
> 1)   The code now draws its coordinates from the Keck data
>      structure (most coordinates coming from Hipparcos).
>      All coordinates have equinox 2000 and have epoch 2000.
>      If we observe a new star that is not in the structure,
>      the code will revert to drawing coordinates from
>      the Hipparcos Catalog.  In all cases, the code advances the
>      coordinates (due to proper motion) to the date of observation.
>
> 2)   The code correctly treats secular acceleration now, which will
>      be removed from our final velocities.
>      We tested high proper motion stars, such as
>      gl699, hd134439 and others and saw that the
>      apparent velocity trend will be removed by the
>      new treatment of sec. accel..
>
> 3)   Improved treatment of the "advancement" of coordinates
>      caused by proper motion
>
> 4)   Coordinates of odd stars added later can be installed, as before,
>      into the file, "kother.ascii".
>
> 5)  The code no longer uses FORTRAN to compute the
>      Solar System ephemeris from JPL.  An IDL code from
>      Craig Marquardt replaces it.  Of course, the Solar System
>      ephemeris from JPL is still a crucial database.
>
> 6)   The keck bary code still resides, as always, in /mir3/bary ,
>      and is run by typing, "kbarylog".  All functionality
>      is transparently the same.
>
> 7)   The official keck structure resides, as always, in
>      /further/paul/idle/kdop/kvel/keck_st.dat .
>      It was modified today.  Chris will alert Paul
>      to copy it to DTM (a few additions will be made soon).
>      The new keck structure will contain all of the metal-rich
>      stars, but with severe restriction on observing cadence,
>      to be discussed by us later.

> Onward,
